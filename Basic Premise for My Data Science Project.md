For my data science project, I utilized ten methodologies to pinpoint the driving conditions that have the greatest effects on the frequency and severity of car accidents during the summer season of the United States.

I chose to use a dataset for the United States because it was the most in-depth and thorough dataset I could find on Kaggle about car accidents. I also specifically narrowed the seasons down to only summer because my target audience were solely Malaysians. Therefore, data related to seasons other than summer would be irrelavent to my audience.
